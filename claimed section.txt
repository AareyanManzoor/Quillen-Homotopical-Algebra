Hello everyone, this is where to claim sections. We plan to get the first draft done by september 7, please pick your sections accordingly. Pick one section at a time, if you complete your section then you can indicate it and pick another section.

EDIT: date extended, lets try september 17.

pick a section example:
``ch 1 (3-12): Aareyan ''
done section example:
``ch 1 (3-12): Aareyan %done'' 
Feel free to ask for help with sections in this document and also on the discord.

There is a latex scan in mathpix scan.tex, and the work of an older group in the folder tex from old group. Feel free to use these to aid your work.

Please READ THE STYLE GUIDE and the preambles before starting any typing.
(we are using the pdf page number as the original book resets page number at each section)
